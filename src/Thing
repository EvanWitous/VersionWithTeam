My name is Evan Witous:

    Over this past summer I got a job in Atlanta teaching at a tech camp. It was pretty cool, because I got to teach a few different game development classes there.
    One of the classes was a VR game development class using Unity. It was VERY hard to teach, because of the time limitations, the lack of experience that the students
    had, and the requirements for the class were very ambitious. However, I loved every sleepless night at that place, because the people I worked with were great, and
    it was awesome to help kids pursue their passions. The end.
